# Snake-game-Lars-Versteeg
A Java Snake game I made for an assessment when I was in my first year of university.
The big challenge of this assignment for me was to figure out how exactly to make the Snake move with all its bodyparts attached,
having an animation built in the application with timers, highscore and increased difficulty overtime made it a really challenging assessment

Problems arrived very quickly after making the canvas for the snake. The Bodypart code for the head went all over the place. I solved more
bugs for the bodyparts alone than for the rest of the functions. I solved these by trying numerous amounts of sketchy ideas that might actually work,
and I figurerd out the math behind it and how much I was overthinking the whole idea of the snake.

Definitely start with reading everything thorough and properly instead of starting to code instantely. This would've helped me calm down a lot more,
and get a better picture in my head.

I solve problems, difficult bugs and challenges by drawing the functionality out on paper, to know exactly what I want and how I want it to work.
This gives me time to think things through on my own and most of the time I realise that certain aspects of my design are correct.
